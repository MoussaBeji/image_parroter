Code to go with StackAbuse article on using Django with Celery and Redis

### local dev setup

1) install Redis as described in blog post 

2) clone repo

source venv/bin/activate
```

4) install python requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5) start redis-server in its own terminal window

redis-server
```

6) start celery worker in its own terminal window with the python virtual env from step 3 activated and in the same directory as the manage.py script

```
(venv) celery worker -A image_parroter --loglevel=info
```
Or if you use windows 
```
(venv) celery worker -A image_parroter --loglevel=info -P threads
```
